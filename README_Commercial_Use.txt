3. ROYALTY TERMS FOR COMMERCIAL USERS

Any company or entity wishing to use this model in a commercial context agrees to:
- Sign a license agreement with the author
- Pay a royalty fee equal to **5% of net revenue** generated from products, services, or processes that substantially rely on this model
- Report usage and revenue in good faith on a quarterly or annual basis

Failure to comply may result in legal action and revocation of usage rights.

4. COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE

This model offers significant benefits for commercial R&D and innovation:
- **Efficient simulation of emergent structures** using only informational interactions
- **Novel algorithmic foundation** for quantum-like behavior without quantum computation
- **Flexible generalization** to multiple domains (AI, neuroscience, decentralized communication)
- Potential applications include:
  - Generative models with emergent structure
  - Decentralized consensus without fixed topology
  - Simulation tools for high-complexity systems (biological, quantum, or networked)

Using this model commercially may provide early-mover advantage in a class of algorithms that combine emergent structure, nonlocality, and information theory.

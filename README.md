This repository contains the LaTeX source, Python simulation code, and supporting materials for the research project:

**"Emergent Locality from Informational Graph Dynamics: A Constructive Model of Quantum-like Behavior"** by *Igor Opolinsky, ChatGPT, Gemini (2025)*

---

## 🧠 Summary

We propose a model in which quantum-like behavior and notions of locality emerge from the evolution of a fully connected graph of informational interactions. Each node in the graph carries an internal state vector (`σ_i ∈ ℝ^d`), and each directed edge `K(i,j)` describes the strength of informational flow from node `j` to node `i`.

The model incorporates:
- **Hebbian-type plasticity** in the connectivity matrix,
- **Nonlinear normalization dynamics** of internal states,
- **Emergence of locality** and "particles" without predefined geometry.

Simulations demonstrate:
- Stable clusters (interpreted as "particles"),
- Disconnected regions (interpreted as "vacuum"),
- Probabilistic effects under partial observation (suggesting emergence of a Born-rule-like behavior).

## 🧪 Simulations

The model is implemented in Python 3 using NumPy and Matplotlib.  
Internal state dimensionality `d` can be set to:
- `d=1`: Scalar states → domain separation  
- `d=2`: SU(2)-like behavior → symmetry breaking into orthogonal clusters  
- `d=3`: SU(3)-like behavior → stable particle-like entities

### 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`

### ▶️ Running the Simulation

Navigate to the `code/` directory and run:

```bash
python3 simulation.py
```

Edit the parameter set inside the script to explore different dimensionalities and seed values.
